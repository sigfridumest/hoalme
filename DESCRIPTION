Description: Higher Order Asymptotic Inference for the Linear Mixed Effects Model.
	hoalme package computes accurate intervals for scalar fixed effects and variance component parameters in the mixed linear model using maximum likelihood estimation
	and small sample asymptotics (higher order asymptotics) techniques, particularly the modified ratio as proposed by Fraser & Reid and developed in unpublished PhD Thesis
	'Highly Accurate Tests for the Mixed Linear Model' by Sigfrido Iglesias-Gonzalez (2007).
